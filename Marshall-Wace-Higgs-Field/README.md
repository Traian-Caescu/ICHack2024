Inspiration
We started EnViz because we saw how many students struggle with physics. It's a subject full of amazing ideas, but often they seem too abstract or hard to grasp. We wanted to make those big concepts not just easier to understand, but also fun to explore. Our goal was to show that physics isn't just about equations on a boardâ€”it's the science of how the universe works, and it's everywhere around us.

What it does
EnViz brings physics to life through interactive simulations. It lets students see and play with physics concepts, like gravity, motion, and energy. By moving sliders or pressing buttons, they can see how changing different factors affects things in real life. It's like having a physics lab on your computer or phone, where you can experiment without any limits.

How we built it
To build EnViz, we embarked on extensive research to accurately understand and code each physics module and formula, ensuring the educational content's reliability and depth. We utilized Python for its robust libraries to handle the complex calculations behind the simulations, bringing these concepts to life. These simulations were then integrated into a web interface using JavaScript, allowing for real-time interactivity and visualization. This approach enabled us to combine Python's computational capabilities with JavaScript's dynamic presentation, creating an engaging and interactive platform where users can explore and manipulate physics concepts directly, enhancing their learning experience.

Challenges we ran into
In developing EnViz, we faced significant challenges, notably in making PhD-level physics content accessible to high school students and in the technical integration of backend and frontend systems. Researching and simplifying complex physics concepts to spark interest among younger learners required a delicate balance of depth and accessibility, challenging us to rethink traditional educational approaches. Additionally, merging the Python-based computational backend with the JavaScript-driven interactive frontend presented technical hurdles. These included ensuring real-time responsiveness and seamless data flow for the interactive simulations. Overcoming these challenges demanded a collaborative effort, innovative problem-solving, and rigorous testing to deliver an engaging and educationally rich user experience.
